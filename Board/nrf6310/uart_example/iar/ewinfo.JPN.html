Example project on UART usage to communicate with PC

DESCRIPTION
===========
 
   Simple UART example that transmits and receives through the configured pins as serial device.
   The configure pins needs to be redirected to a COM port (for some terminal program like putty which
  can listen to this COM port through a terminal session)
   When the program start it will transmit "START: " through this serial device using @ref simple_uart_putstring
  and this should be visible on the terminal.
   All typed characters on this terminal will be transmitted to this program through @ref simple_uart_get and
  when an exit character 'q' or 'Q' is typed this program will end into an infinite loop after transmitting 
  "EXIT!" on the new line of the terminal.
   note This example is not just for COM ports but can be used for any UART connection, COM port redirection
        is for visual verification.
   note Setting the define ENABLE_LOOPBACK_TEST will assume that the TX_PIN_NUMBER is connected to RX_PIN_NUMBER
        and this example is used to test the loopback. In this case no com port can be used as the data flows
        from TX to RX and ERROR_PIN is set high for any loss of data.
   note Configure your terminal application for 38400 bauds, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

   The example project is compatible with, on Nordic Semi nRF6310 - PCA10005 evaluation
  boards. By default, the project is configured to use the J-Link SWD interface.

CONFIGURATION
=============

   Make sure that the following jumpers and swiches are correctly configured on the
  nRF6310 evaluation board:
  Switches:
  S8  - VBUS
  S9  - ON
  S11 - ON
  
  PCA10005 board:
  Jumpers:
   K1 - 2-3
   P4 - 1-3 2-4 (32 kHz crystal)

  The Blinky application is downloaded to the iFlash.

GETTING STARTED
===============

  1) Build and download the program.

  2) Run the program.
